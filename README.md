# MelodeerGUI
Linux terminal GUI for Melodeer API. In order to build, compiled Melodeer libraries are needed (study Makefile for info on directory construction). The work is still in its initial phases, but has basic functionality. I have included melodeergui executable that was compiled on Fedora and tested on both Fedora and Ubuntu. However, there are some bugs and compability issues I have noticed with xfce terminal (and MacOS if compiled there) - so that will soon be fixed!
